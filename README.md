# Practical-JavaScript

> Before building this Todo List i have been doing some practical exercises by following video tutorial of Gordon Zhu and have been learning simple steps of building simple app. 

# Todo List

> This App is a prototype of http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/ but with less options. Build only using HTML javaScript and CSS can vary due to user preferences.

> Studying this project I learned about:

- Functions inside of functions.
- About things the debugger can tell you.
- Data types and comparisons.
- How to view `.displayTodos` should use `forEach`.
- Also repeated other things that i already new!
